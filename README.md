Wear ScreenInfo
===============

This is a utility that shows all kinds of useful information about the
display on your Android and Wear OS devices.

Wear ScreenInfo can be run as a regular application on any device, but is
also available as a watch face on Wear OS. This allows you to get a
complete understanding of every aspect of the display as either an Activity,
or a watch face service.

Some of the information presented includes the display resolution, density,
physical size, resource qualifiers, insets, canvas size, and view size. Extra
information about the hardware is also presented, such as processor, board,
manufacturer, and firmware build id. See the screenshots below for examples
of what the application looks like.
